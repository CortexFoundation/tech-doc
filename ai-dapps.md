# AI DApps

The application built on the blockchain, known as  "DApp", has many different characteristics than the traditional application. Most distinctively, a DApp is an application that enables direct interaction between end users and providers. 

An AI DApp adds AI features to the DApp and expands its usability. AI DApps would typically have their own suite of associated contracts with various ml models on the blockchain which they use to encode business logic and allow persistent storage of their consensus-critical state.

## AI DApp Use Cases

There are various applications to utilize contracts with ml models. Below examples are only use cases thought of by the Cortex team alone. It is almost certain that the community will conceive many more and better use cases for AI on the blockchain.

- DeFi: credit report, anti-fraud in decentralized exchanges, p2p financing, insurance, cryptocurrency lending

- Gaming: AI judge, player agent, NPC, assistant/coaching/education

- Global Climate Action & Carbon Credit Management and Trading: collects environmental data and puts on the blockchain for a transparent carbon pricing system

- AI Governance: stablecoins based on machine learning, sentiment analysis, decentralized decision making, malicious behavior detection, smart resource allocation

- Others: on-chain data mining, facial recognition, recommendation, chatbot, machine translation, voice synthesis, etc.

## Developer Tools

 AI DApp development is similar to DApp development on Ethereum. It requires an understanding of Solidity programming language, web3.js, and JSON-RPC API. Below is a list of links to get you started:

  - [Solidity Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Solidity is the Smart Contract language developed by Ethereum, which compiles to CVM (Cortex Virtual Machine) opcodes.
  - [Cortex-Remix](https://cerebro.cortexlabs.ai/remix) -  a browser-based compiler and IDE using programming language Solidity.
  - [Web3 JavaScript API](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) - This is the main JavaScript SDK to use when you want to interact with an Ethereum node.
- [JSON RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) - This is the low-level JSON RPC 2.0 interface to interface with a node. 

## AI DApp Examples

#### DeFi
For example, a decentralized lending app can run an AI algorithm to determine your interest rate based on your personal credit history. The AI used to analyze your credit score is not a black box, but instead, every step of the AI inference is transparent to prevent discrimination and ensure fairness. 

#### Gaming
CryptoKitties would be much cuter, more life-like, and unique if they incorporated AI. Imagine these kitties moving dynamically and behaving uniquely depending on your personal experience interacting with them. While Ethereum is not able to execute AI models and allow for this user experience, this is something that Cortex can uniquely enable.

#### Insurance
Blockchain finds many use cases in the insurance industry, where immutability, fairness, openness, and transparency are in high demand. AI can help improve underwriting decisions, better manage risks, and prevent fraud. An insurance DAO powered by on-chain AI can bring us better, cheaper, fairer, and less bureaucratic insurance. 

#### Anti-fake AI
The emergence of deepfakes (AI-manipulated videos that are indistinguishable to the human eye) poses a significant threat to society. Social stability will inevitably suffer if video recordings can simply be dismissed as untrustworthy in court. Anti-fake AI algorithms (algorithms that detect whether a video has been tampered with) will run on the blockchain to ensure their transparency and fairness, especially if there were to be used in court.
