# AI Contracts

The idea of smart contracts is not originated by Cortex development team but by cryptographer Nick Szabo in 1994. Ethereum later implemented a nearly Turing-complete language on its blockchain and popularized the usage of smart contracts. Cortex adds machine learning operators to allow various interactions within the smart contracts, further expanding the capability of the smart contracts.

## Solidity

Cortex officially supports Solidity programming language to develop AI contracts and complie to CVM bytcode.

  - [Solidity Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Solidity is the Smart Contract language developed by Ethereum, which compiles to CVM (Cortex Virtual Machine) opcodes.
  - [Cortex-Remix]() -  a browser-based compiler and IDE using programming language Solidity.
