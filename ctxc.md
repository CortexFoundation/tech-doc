# CTXC

CTXC is the native token used within Cortex. It is used to pay for computational resources within the CVM. CTXC can be stored in Cortex Wallet ([download through official website](https://www.cortexlabs.ai/)) or any of the supported exchanges.

 Cortex charges a fee, known as endorphin, per computational step that is executed in a contract or transaction to prevent deliberate attacks and abuse on the Cortex network (See [endorphine](endorphin.md)).

## Getting CTXC

You can get CTXC with the following methods:
