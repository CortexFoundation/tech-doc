#Cortex Remix

Cortex Remix is a browser-based compiler and IDE using programming language Solidity. It is based on [Remix IDE](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide). It supports the compilation and deployment of AI smart contracts and debugging transactions.

Cortex Remix mainly consists of two functional modules: compilation and deployment. 

## Compilation

The compilation module supports compilation and optimization of AI smart contracts. complied abi, bytecode, and other information can also be gathered here.

## Deployment

The contract deployment module can deploy the contract to the Cortex blockchain network with the support of Cortex Wallet, realizing on-chain AI model inference.

## Installation



## Developing

Developing on Cortex closely resembles writing Solidity contracts on Ethtereum, but with added instruction sets. The instruction sets allows contracts to interact with AI models and data on Cortex and make inference.



## Debugging



## Testing
