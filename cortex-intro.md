# Introduction

The current challenge to executing machine learning programs on the conventional blockchain is that the virtual machine is extremely inefficient when running any nontrivial machine learning models. Therefore, most people think it is impossible to run AI on the blockchain. 

To the surprise of many, Cortex has built a blockchain whose virtual machine (CVM) utilizes the GPU, which can execute AI programs on-chain, and is compatible with the EVM. In other words, the Cortex chain can execute all the Ethereum Dapps, and on top of that, incorporate machine learning into these Dapps. For the first time, instead of a black box, we can run ml models on the blockchain in a decentralized, immutable, and transparent manner âˆ’ network consensus verifies every step of the AI inference.

## The Cortex Ecosystem - An Open Decentralized AI Ecosystem

Besides Dapp developers, users, and miners, Cortex brings a new relevant party into its blockchain ecosystem: AI developers. 
AI developers upload trained machine learning models onto the storage layer of the Cortex chain. These models can later be either inferred on their own or incorporated into smart contracts by Dapp developers. Each time an AI model is called, it's model uploader gets rewards in CTXCs, coming from a part of the network transaction fees. 
This mechanism incentivizes AI developers to train and upload better models, leading to an evolving decentralized AI ecosystem; good models are openly distributed on the Cortex blockchain instead of being monopolized by a few big corporations.

####AI Smart Contract and AI DApp

Cortex adds machine learning support to smart contracts and DApps to adapt to real-world use cases. Developers can use the most popular language, Solidity, to create truly intelligent smart contracts and AI-enhanced DApps.

#### AI Inference Engine - Synapse

A deterministic inference engine that guarantees exactly the same result in heterogenetic computing environments. The inference result no longer comes from a third-party, eliminating the trust problem.

#### Decentralizing AI Resarch

Foster a world of open-source models where AI technology and the associated algorithms are made open and controlled democratically.

#### Cortex Virtual Machine

The CVM is EVM-compatible with added AI features that utilizes the GPU, allowing developers to use Solidity language with unique infer instructions to call the algorithms.

#### Cuckoo Cycle PoW Algorithm

Most promising ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm to establish a friendly mining environment. Anti-ASIC is a firm belief in Cortex in order to lower the mining requirements to lay the foundation for future scalability in AI computing demand market.

#### Cortex MRT

A deterministic quantization framework to convert MXNet models to fixed-point models that are executable on the Cortex blockchain.
