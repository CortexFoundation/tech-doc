# Introduction

The current challenge to executing machine learning programs on the conventional blockchain is that the virtual machine is extremely inefficient when running any nontrivial machine learning models. Therefore, most people think it is impossible to run AI on the blockchain. 

To the surprise of many, Cortex has built a blockchain whose virtual machine (CVM) utilizes the GPU, which can execute AI programs on-chain, and is compatible with the EVM. In other words, the Cortex chain can execute all the Ethereum Dapps, and on top of that, incorporate machine learning into these Dapps. For the first time, instead of a black box, we can run ml models on the blockchain in a decentralized, immutable, and transparent manner âˆ’ network consensus verifies every step of the AI inference.
