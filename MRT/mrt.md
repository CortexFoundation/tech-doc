# Model Representation Tool

MRT, stands for Model Representation Tool, is a deterministic quantization framework that enables model inference in the limited-resource and strictly deterministic environment of blockchain, ushering in a new generation of AI smart contracts.

MRT is designed to convert the floating point model supported by nnvm into a fixed-point model that is executable on CVM while preventing significant loss of precision. The quantization method reduces the output number field of all layers of the model to INT8 or INT32 in order to simulate the floating-point network and converts the operators involved in the floating-point operation into integer operators using fuse and rewrite. Quantization ensures no overflow and guarantees the deterministic outcome of the model execution.
