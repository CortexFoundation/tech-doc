# Cortex Remix

[Cortex Remix](https://cerebro.cortexlabs.ai/remix) is a browser-based compiler and IDE using programming language Solidity. It is based on [Remix IDE](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide). It supports the compilation and deployment of AI smart contracts and debugging transactions.

Developing on Cortex closely resembles writing Solidity contracts on Ethtereum, but with added instruction set. The instruction sets allows contracts to interact with models and data on Cortex and make inference.

Cortex Remix is designed to use 

Cortex Remix mainly consists of two functional modules: compilation and deployment. 

## Compilation

The compilation module supports compilation and optimization of AI smart contracts. Complied abi, bytecode, and additional information are also displayed in this module.

## Deployment

The deployment module can help deploy AI smart contracts to the Cortex network with the support of Cortex Wallet, allowing for on-chain inference.
